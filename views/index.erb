				The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.<br><br>

				Type a random word or phrase above and give me a number to shift that by, and I'll show you that is ran through a Caesar Cipher.
